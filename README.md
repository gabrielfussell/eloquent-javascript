# eloquent-javascript
These are my notes and code as I work through the textbook Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke

While I'm in the middle of a chapter its contents and exercises are in the index.html and script.js files in the root folder. 
When I've finished I move the contents into the exercises and notes folders.
