# Eloquent Javascript
## Description
These are my notes and exercise files as I work through the book Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke. My goal is to improve my knowledge of Javascript and also create an easy to read set of reference notes on the basics of the language that I can refer back to. As of mid 2022 I have put this project on hold to focus on .NET and back end topics.

## How to Run
To run this project first clone the repository to your local machine. Then open index.html from the root of the project in the web browser of your choice and hit the F12 key to view the console output. To run a different file either change the path of the second script tag in index.html, or paste the contents from another file into script.js.

When running a file from the Exercises or Notes folders you may have to uncomment one or more code blocks to see output in the console.

As I work through chapters in the book I am using script.js as a working file, then transferring the contents into one or more new .js files once I am finished the chapter and exercises.
